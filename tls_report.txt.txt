1. TLS Handshake Summary
The TLS handshake is the process that establishes a secure session between a client and a server.
It includes Client Hello, Server Hello, Certificate exchange, key generation, and encrypted communication setup.

2. MITM Protection
TLS prevents man-in-the-middle attacks using:
- Server authentication via digital certificates
- Encrypted key exchange using public-key cryptography
- Message integrity validation through HMAC
- Session keys unique to each connection

3. TLS Usage in HTTPS
When HTTPS is used, TLS encrypts the entire HTTP communication between the browser and web server.
It ensures that sensitive data such as credentials, payment info, or messages cannot be read or modified.
